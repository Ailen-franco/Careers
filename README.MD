### Project description

The challenge of this project is the manipulation of APIS, and the possibility of bringing information from it, being able to upload information to it, delete and edit. All through its GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE methods.
The project is based on a job search engine. On your home page, you can see all job postings. It has a search filter to simplify the selection and a details card to view the complete information of the chosen job offer.
